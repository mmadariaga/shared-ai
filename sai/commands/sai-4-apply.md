# Isolation Mode
- Ignore all previous conversation.
- Use only the data inside <TASK>. TASK is not a template, it's a instruction set.
- If required information is missing, ask for it.
- If you are about to use external or prior context, STOP and say: "Potential context pollution detected, stopping, open a new chat".

<TASK>

  Fetch @sai/instructions/change-picker.md and follow it exactly.

  ## Prerequisite checks
  Fetch @sai/instructions/prereqs.md

  Also verify before proceeding:
  - `openspec/changes/{change-name}/implementation.md` exists. If not, STOP and print: "implementation.md not found for '{change-name}'. Run /sai-3-implement first."

  Do not create or modify any files if this check fails.

  ## Load behaviors (in order)
  Fetch @skills/budget/SKILL.md and use it
  Fetch @skills/safe-operations/SKILL.md and use it

  ## Load instructions (in order)
  Fetch @sai/instructions/apply.md and follow those instructions exactly.
  Fetch @sai/instructions/remember.md

  ## Run
  **User's request:** $ARGUMENTS

  ## Completion
  "Done" means ALL of the following, together — a single Step finishing (or its commit landing) is NOT completion:
  - Every Step in `openspec/changes/{change-name}/implementation.md` has all its checkboxes `[x]`, confirmed by the Final sweep.
  - All human verification gates have been reviewed.
  - All commits are done.

  If any Step remains unchecked, your work is NOT complete: do not print the completion message, do not mention `/sai-5-review`, and do not end — dispatch the next unchecked Step instead.

  MANDATORY STOP: Only once all the conditions above hold, your work is COMPLETE, STOP and print exactly: "Implementation applied. Run `/sai-5-review {name}` in a new chat when ready."
</TASK>

Follow instruction on <TASK> step by step
